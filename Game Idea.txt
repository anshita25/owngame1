I saw and played this game known as song trivia which truly caught my interest. In this game, the host will provide his friends wih a link and then the players can give themselves a name, there are many categories in it like pop,rock songs,bollywood songs etc. Once the game is started there will be a short track which will be played and then you will be provided with 4 options, you have to guess the most probable answer related to that song and as fast as you are giving the answer,the more scores you will gain. And at last there is a leaderboard to show the players their performance. Also there are these avatars given to the players.
